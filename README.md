Student Academic Platform
At African Leadership University, we identify challenges and create innovative solutions. This semester, you and your team will address a common issue among ALU students: managing academic responsibilities while balancing university life.

Students across all years struggle with tracking assignments, remembering class schedules, and monitoring their attendance. This often leads to missed deadlines, poor attendance, and unnecessary academic stress that affects performance across ALU's campuses.

Your Mission: Develop a mobile application that serves as a personal academic assistant for ALU students. Your app should help users organize their coursework, track their schedule, and monitor their academic engagement throughout the term.

Core Application Features
1. Home Dashboard
The dashboard must display:

Today's date and current academic week

A list of today's scheduled academic sessions

Assignments due within the next seven days

Current overall attendance percentage

Visual warning indicator when attendance falls below 75%

Summary count of pending assignments

2. Assignment Management System
Users will be able to:

Create new assignments by entering:

Assignment title (required text field)

Due date (using date picker)

Course name (text input)

Priority level (optional: High/Medium/Low)

View all assignments in a list sorted by due date

Mark assignments as completed with a check action

Remove assignments from the list

Edit assignment details if changes are needed

3. Academic Session Scheduling
Users will be able to:

Schedule new academic sessions by entering:

Session title (required text field)

Date (using date picker)

Start time (using time picker)

End time (using time picker)

Location (optional text field)

Session type (select from: Class, Mastery Session, Study Group, PSL Meeting)

View weekly schedule displaying all sessions

Record attendance for each session using Present/Absent toggle

Remove scheduled sessions when cancelled

Modify session details if arrangements change

4. Attendance Tracking
The application must:

Calculate attendance percentage automatically based on recorded attendance

Display attendance metrics clearly on the dashboard

Provide alerts when attendance drops below 75%

Maintain attendance history for reference

Technical Requirements
Navigation Structure
Implement a BottomNavigationBar with three primary tabs:

Dashboard - Main overview screen

Assignments - Assignment management interface

Schedule - Session planning and calendar view

Data Storage (OPTIONAL)
Choose one implementation method:

Basic Approach: Use shared_preferences to store user data

Simplified Approach: Maintain data during current session only

Advanced Approach: Implement SQLite database for structured storage

User Interface Standards
Apply ALU's official color palette (The colors in the screenshot below)

Ensure clear labeling of all form fields

Design responsive layouts with no pixel overflow errors.

Implement input validation for date/time fields

Maintain consistent navigation patterns

Below is a sample UI with dummy text. Please make modifications to the UI as it suits you to ensure you meet all the required functionality but maintain the colors branding.

Academic Integrity Notice
AI Usage Policy:

All code must be your own original work
Projects with over 50% AI-generated content will be penalized

The demo video must demonstrate your genuine understanding of the code implementation

You may use AI tools for learning and debugging assistance only

Deliverables
Submit a PDF document with the following:
A write-up of what you struggled with and how you solved it.
A link to your GitHub repo, and every member should have a branch. All team members must have visible contributions in commit history. Clear project structure and readable code.
Demo video: The demo video will be focused on explaining the functionality of your app and demonstrating your genuine understanding of the implementation. Therefore, we expect you to understand and be able to explain the code you submitted. Please make sure to talk about every criterion on the rubric and how you implemented it and show us how it is working.
Please ensure that you run your app either on an emulator or on a physical mobile device. Unfortunately, any app running solely in a browser looking like a website will not be graded, as it undermines the primary goal of this course: to learn how to create functional mobile applications. 
Include a link to the group contribution tracker. Each group should make a copy of this group contribution tracker (linksto an external site) and use it to track every team member's contribution. Failure to include the contribution tracker will result in your work not being graded.
File naming: GroupName_AssignmentName.
